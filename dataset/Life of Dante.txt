Biography Classics Nonfiction Cultural
Life of Dante is a fascinating and hugely important literary work both in terms of the revelations it provides into the lives and thoughts of two great Italian men, and also as an early example of biography. Boccaccio was a fervent admirer of Dante, and as such, he embarked upon writing this short piece as a vindication of the merits of his illustrious fellow-citizen. Yet far from being simply an account of the misfortunes that befell the great Florentine exile, the resulting Life of Dante also gives precious insight into Boccaccio's own ideas on a wide variety of issues including poetry, literature, women, and society.
