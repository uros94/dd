Over the hill, all outta ducks to give, and suddenly life is looking up . . .even if you're living with a ghost and fighting off werewolves.

Moving back to Savannah changed my life in all the best ways. New job. New friends. As far from my ex-husband as possible.

I didn’t count on the Shadow World intensifying its hold on my life.

Color me surprised, when a new job lands in my lap watching over a fairy ring. Worth ten times what I’d make anywhere else, it seems too good to be true. I take it anyway.

And that’s when things get weird.

Spells are cast on my friends that seems to make them lose their marbles.

I’ve got a Bigfoot baking in my kitchen.

And a skeleton is quickly becoming my go-to guy. Which is silly because the eye candy strutting around in front of me is drool worthy. (I’m looking at you, Crash. Really looking 0_0)

Nothing in Savannah is what it seems, and the magic and undercurrents of this city are pulling me onto a dangerous path.

But with a Fae Queen begging my help, and the darkness closing in, I can only do one thing.

Pop a couple Advil, and kick some serious ducking butt.
